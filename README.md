> * Hello there, welcome to my profile! Here you'll find some cool informations about me! 😄

## 🔍 About me
My name is Geovane and I'm form Brasília, the capital city of Brazil! Since I was a kid, I've always been interested on computers and games. At ten years old I created my first program in `Batch Script`, I don't remember what the program did, but It doesn't matter. Currently I'm focused in learning Javascript and making Discord bots.
